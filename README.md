# Introduction
This project is an in progress .NET implementation of the [OGC SensorThings 1.0 spec](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/15-078r6/15-078r6.html) server. 

One of the main goals of this implementation has been to enable the embedding of a SensorThings server into a Xamarin.Android application.

# Known Deficiencies
The following capabilities defined in the spec are not yet implemented at this time:
* Deep tree creation of entities
* Enforcement of associations between entities
* Query/filter capabilities
